## Component Architecture

### State Management
- **Questions State**: Array of question objects with comprehensive metadata
- **UI State**: Active filters, search terms, form states
- **Form State**: New question data with validation

### Question Types

2. **Time Allocation**: Consider total assessment time when setting individual question times
3. **Skill Relevance**: Select skills that align with the question content and job requirements
4. **Clear Descriptions**: Write detailed, specific question descriptions

### Question Creation Flow
1. Click "Add Question" or type-specific buttons
2. Select question type (Management/Professional)
3. Enter question title and description
4. Add relevant skills using autocomplete
5. Set time allocation using visual slider
6. Save and continue adding questions
